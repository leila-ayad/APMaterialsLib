# APMaterialsLib

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is the backend code for the Materials Library. This program serves the Abstract Picnic art community. It's purpose is to create a place for group members to swap leftover materials or borrow each other's tools. The app functions similar to Craigslist. Communications about materials are handled externally and it is the user's responsibility to delete a material if it has been claimed.
